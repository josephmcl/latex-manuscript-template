Within a practical context the numerical approximations to the solution to PDEs can be sought in three different ways: FDM, FEM, and FVM. 
In a broad sense, these terms describe classes of numerical methods derived from distinct methodologies; 
the specific formulation of a problem under a given class of numerical method is often further characterized by distinct constraints unique to the problem, but still shares a mathematical foundation to other formulations in its class of numerical method. 
This section illustrates the history and mathematical derivations of the three numerical methods discussed throughout the paper.

\subsubsection{Development}
FDMs are derived from a truncated Taylor series expansion yielding 
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{du}{dx} = {u(x) - u(x + h)}{h}
\end{equation}
