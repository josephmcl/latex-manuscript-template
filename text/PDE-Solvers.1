Solvers designed for the high-performance applications typically implement FEM schemes to discretize continuous systems. 


Libraries such as FMEM and DUNE are widely implemented frameworks for constructing nodal discretizations, often intended for high-performance systems \cite{anderson2021mfem, bastian2021dune}. 

for \textit{unstructured grids} where the discretization is comprised of nodal elements that lack a structured order (e.g. rectilinear.)
